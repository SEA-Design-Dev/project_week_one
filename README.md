# Code Fellows Front-End DA - Project Week: One
## Mark Buchthal, Brian Fink, Molly Kent, & Alina To

### Description

For our Project Week: One, we created a front-end prototype for a new app branding marketing site. We were given a comp for full desktop view, and created a fully-functional prototype following mobile-first approach, tailored for handheld mobile device, tablet, and desktop RWD views. 

Besides semantically correct HTML, we focused heavily on Sass architecture. We built smaller components, then built up surrounding pieces from there. As a four person team, we made a plan based on defining component pieces, then delegated responsibilities among the group. When we ran into overlap issues, we resolved them cooperatively. Along the way, we tested on mobile (Safari and Chrome), tablet (Safari), and desktop (Safari, Chrome, and Firefox). 

## From our initial assignment repo:
