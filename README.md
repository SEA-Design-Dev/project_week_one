# Welcome to Project Week: One

You are completing your first month in the Code Fellows Front-End Development Accelerator. Now it's time to exercise all the new things you have learned.

### Here is the scenario:

You are a 4 person team and the next project you are to deliver is the front-end prototype for a new app branding marketing site. The expectation is that you can deliver a fully functional, mobile first, and desktop RWD version of the provided comp.

Again, the design team came up short and there is no mobile comp, so please use your best judgement for how this will work, look and feel on a handheld mobile device and tablet.

Think COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE! Think about breaking the UI up into it's smallest parts and building up from there.

### Fork and build

You know the drill, fork the repo and let it take on a life of it's own, you are on control of your own destiny!

### Be agile

It is HIGHLY suggested that you come up with a plan of attack. It's a four person team (2 pairs, no solo work!), so planning will help reduce the amount of over-lap work. Assign some responsibilities of things to be completed that can be addressed while others are addressing other needs of the project.

QA IS ESSENTIAL! Make sure that all your work is being reviewed as your progress. Catch bugs early and solve problems before they get too big.


### The comp

See the the `comps/` directory. Choose the one that you want to execute on and DO IT!

### The project spec:

There are three individual deliverables:

1. Mobile/tablet/desktop HTML/CSS/JS prototype
1. Style-guide view that illustrates the primary typography, color palette, and core UI elements of the view
1. A view or series of views that illustrate the individual major components of the design isolated from the total view, this view should also illustrate responsiveness

### The grading spec:

1. A clean Git project; .gitignore, clean commitment history and quality comments
1. Semantically correct HTML
1. No CSS, all Sass all day long
1. Completed/working version of the comp
1. Links to style guide view and component library
1. Working carousel
1. Update top nav and link to each section of the view / smooth scrolling a +
1. jQuery plug-ins are optional, but limited to one per project
1. Deployed to http://surge.sh/
